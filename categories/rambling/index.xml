      <description>This wet-lab researcher built a website! With the help of some computational friends, of course. I spent a good chunk of my evenings the past few days learning html and markdown syntax, all because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give my money to Big Server like Squarespace.
On a bit more serious note, I wanted to make a website because I felt like I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what life was really like as a PhD student until I met some students during my interview weekends at grad schools.</description>
